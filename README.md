## Installation and Building Instructions

### Installation : [INSTALL.md](camlventure/INSTALL.md)

### How to Play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move around. Your player sprite is represented by the emote 👾. Trees (🌴) and cacti (🌵) are background, and won't do anything. Eggs (🥚) represent wild camon, and if you encounter one, you may run from the battle (meaning that you don't have to fight, returning you to the map). Snarly Hacklings (🤖) and Snarly Apprentice Ryan (😡) are enemy trainers that you cannot run from - once encountered, you must fight. Snarly Hacker Clarkson (😈) is the final boss. Navigate to these enemies on the map to battle them!

#### Windows addtional instructions:

If you are running on a windows computer, please run the code in the Visual Studio Code terminal as the emoji sprites won't show up otherwise. Open the terminal to full screen and zoom-out as needed.
